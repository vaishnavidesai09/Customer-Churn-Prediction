# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

# 📌 Project Overview  
- Objective: Develop a predictive model to classify customers as "churn" or "retain" based on historical data.  
- Dataset: Includes customer demographics, transaction history, service usage, and other relevant features.  
- Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn.  

# 🔍 Key Steps  
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns, correlations, and distributions.  
3. Model Building: Training classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
5. Feature Importance: Identifying key factors influencing churn.  

# 🚀 Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the model:  
   ```bash
